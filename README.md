## Hello World! This is RichadoWonosas!ðŸ‘‹

### About me
- Postgraduate, studied at University of Southampton
- Interested in cryptography, programming and game designing
- Learning C, C++, Unity3D, Java, JavaScript, Python, etc.
- Like anime and games, especially music games (I'd prefer to call them **Rhythm Action Games (RAG)**)
- My main page will be moved to [yadora.moe](https://yadora.moe) in order to provide more interactions; The pure front-end version of some pages will remain on [GitHub Pages](https://richadowonosas.github.io).

### Plans
- [x] Design a symmertric encryption scheme (RWSE - Now is RWSE2!)
- [ ] Design a cryptographic hash function (RWSH/RWXH) (actually done, but did not post as repo; Also some performance issues are not currently solved)
- [ ] Make my first front-end minigame
